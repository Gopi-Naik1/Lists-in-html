<dt>Why I Love My Grandmother’s House
</dt>
<dd>First of all, the atmosphere at my grandmother’s house is distinctly different. I am at peace here. There is no noise or pollution because it is in a village. Additionally, there are no traffic jams here. I always wake early so that I can go for a walk and take in some fresh air. My body and mind are both revitalised by the fresh air. My grandmother makes me a delicious breakfast. In the evening, my whole family gathers to share our life stories as our grandfather makes tea.

    My grandparents' home also has a small garden with grass that is a vibrant green colour. In the garden, there are swings as well. There, we also like playing entertaining games with our relatives, including water fights. We frequently spend the evenings sitting on the roof, looking up at the stars.</dd>

<dd>Katiki Waterfalls is located in Katiki village, near Borra Caves. Visitors need to travel and trek to reach the base of the waterfalls. Shared Jeeps safaris will take visitors from Gatevalsa to the railway track, which is 7 km afar. From the railway track, the visitors need to trek 1- 2 km to reach the base of the Waterfall. The whole Journey is adventurous as the road will be bumpy and the trek thrilling through the narrow slippery path. Katiki Waterfall, which originates from the Gosthani River, falls from a height of more than 100 ft. </dd>

<dt>Enjoyment time</dt>
<dd>I enjoy playing outside while picking fresh fruits from the trees and eating freshly prepared vegetables. Frequently, I help my grandmother sow seeds in the garden. There are several reasons why I value this place so highly. There is something incredibly unique about the house. I feel at ease and relaxed here.

<dt>My Hometown</dt>
<dd>My town is my entire world. I was raised there. I have a lot of lovely and endearing memories of it. I used to play there with my friends and cousins during my early years. In my community, everyone is cordial. My town has many trees. I can only think of one spot where I enjoy spending time - my town. My visits home provide me with much delight and satisfaction. In my town, practically every amenity is available, and the roads and bridges are macadamized.
